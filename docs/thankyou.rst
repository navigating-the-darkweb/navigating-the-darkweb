Thank You!
==========

I’m beyond grateful for your support! Writing this book has been a labor of love, and it’s hard to express how much it means to me that you’ve not only chosen to read it, but also chosen to support the hard work that went into creating it. After more than two years of writing, revising, and pouring my heart into every page, your recognition is a reminder that all of that effort was worthwhile.

Your donation is more than just financial support—it's a validation of the time and energy spent crafting something meaningful. I’m committed to keeping the content fresh and up-to-date, so you’ll always have access to the best version of this work. As the world changes, so will this book, and I’m excited to continue sharing that evolution with you.

Thank you for believing in this journey and in the value of the work.

With deep appreciation,

Sébastien Damaye.
