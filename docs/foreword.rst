Motivations for Writing This Book
*********************************

As a cybersecurity professional and security researcher, I’ve always been intrigued by the Dark Web. First, because it is a fantastic adventure from a technical perspective, studying the different darknets, how to access them, why they have been created, how they have been designed, their threat model, and how they evolved. Secondly, because of its “hidden” side, accessing the Dark Web is exciting; it’s a bit like something forbidden, and discovering a new darknet is like connecting to the “Internet” for the first time. This was the initial trigger.

Then, while talking to people, I realized that the Dark Web was relatively unknown. Some of the statements below raised my attention.

- Many people have heard of the Dark Web, but few know what it is, and even fewer have ever connected to a darknet.
- Most people have no clue how to connect to darknets.
- Because of its “hidden” nature, some people think the Dark Web is not on the Internet but on a parallel network or that you need special hardware connected to your network cable to connect to it.
- Many people interchangeably use the terms “Dark Web” and “darknet” to define the same thing, as they think there is only one darknet.
- Some are only aware of one darknet, Tor, and have never heard about I2P, Hyphanet, or ZeroNet.
- Some people have already used Tor but were unaware that Tor features a darknet, as they only used the Tor Browser to “anonymously” browse the Surface Web.
- Some people think that the Dark Web is only for illegal activities, and some believe that it is even unlawful to connect to the Dark Web. When I wrote this book, some people said: “What about if the police would come to know you’re browsing the Dark Web”?

I wrote this book to address many of these questions, demystify the Dark Web, and share my experience with others.

How Is This Book Organized?
***************************

This book has been written to be read from beginning to end, like a story, or used as an encyclopedia so that you can easily refer to a given chapter or section.

- Chapter 1 is a brief introduction that covers the different layers of the Internet (Surface Web, Deep Web, and Dark Web), introduces the concept of darknets, and answers some security-related questions.
- Chapters 2 to 5 are dedicated to the most popular darknets (Tor, I2P, Hyphanet, and ZeroNet), with instructions for installation, configuration, basic usage, and some examples of applications or sites available on these darknets.
- Chapter 6 lists what I’ve found on various darknets, which can’t be exhaustive.
- Chapter 7 deals with intelligence and hunting, with valuable tools for extracting information from various darknet sources and leveraging this information as a security analyst.

Important Note About This Book
******************************

This book is focused on the Dark Web. Topics like Threat Intelligence, Forums, and Darknet Markets are broad topics that have boundaries beyond the Dark Web. Building a relevant Threat Intelligence database requires much more information than just what can be found on the Dark Web, as a lot will be found on the Deep Web (e.g., exploit.in, russianmarket.to, etc.) and even on the Surface Web (e.g., X, Pastebin, etc.). The same applies to Darknet Markets, where many communications and transactions happen outside the Dark Web (e.g., via Telegram [#]_).
