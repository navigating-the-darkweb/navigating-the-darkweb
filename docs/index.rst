Navigating the Dark Web: A Comprehensive Guide to Darknets, Tools, and Intelligence

What Is It?
***********
"Navigating the Dark Web: A Comprehensive Guide to Darknets, Tools, and Intelligence" is an online book written by Sébastien Damaye. It is exlusively hosted online so that everybody can enjoy it for free, but you are very welcome to `support the author <#id1>`_.

Why an Online Book?
*******************
I was initially planning to publish this book on Amazon. However the writing process took me almost two years, and I noticed that the content (Dark Web references, tools, versions, etc.) kept being updated very quickly, forcing me to come back to previous chapters and ensure that the content was always up to date. This is when I began to think that an online book would be a better place, especially because each reader could become a contributor (using the ``Suggest edit`` or ``Open issue`` buttons).

Because all the content is indexed, searching for a particular term is also much easier online.

Acknowledgments and Dedication

This book wouldn't exist without the incredible people who stood by me through every step of the journey.

To my friends and colleagues, thank you for your encouragement, thoughtful feedback, and reminders to keep going when motivation was slowing down. Your support meant a lot to me.

To my family, thank you for your patience, your love, and your quiet support. Whether it was giving me space to write or simply understanding when I disappeared into my head for a while, your presence made all the difference.

I'd like to dedicate this book to my brother, who died unexpectedly in the middle of writing this book.
